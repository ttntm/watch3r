# About watch3r

Have you ever been unsure whether or not you'd already seen a certain movie or lost track of the countless things you wanted to watch or watched already?

IMDb is a great database, but their service is cluttered with unnecessary information, ads and things that aren't quite relevant when making time sensitive couch choices.

That's where the idea for this web application came from - imagine a tool that provides basic information about the listed titles, paired with search and sorting. A place to keep track of your lists and collect your thoughts after watching.

## Features

★ Dedicated Watchlist and Tracklist views

★ Search for movies and series when adding titles to your lists

★ Save date watched, rating and notes for each title in your Tracklist

★ Search and sorting for each list view

★ PWA functionality for mobile devices to access your lists from the couch
