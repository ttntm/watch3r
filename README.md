# About watch3r

Not sure if you have already seen a certain movie? Lost track of the countless things you wanted to watch or watched already? Got different lists in different places you keep forgetting about?

That's where the idea for this web application came from - imagine a tool that provides basic information about the listed titles, paired with search and sorting. A place to keep track of your lists and collect your thoughts after watching.

## Features

★ Dedicated Watchlist and Tracklist views

★ Search for movies and series when adding titles to your lists

★ Save date watched, rating and notes for each title in your Tracklist

★ Search and sorting for each list view

★ PWA functionality for mobile devices to access your lists from the couch
